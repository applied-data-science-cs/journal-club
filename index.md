## Applied Data Science Journal Club


The **_Applied Data Science_** journal club explores research topics in Data Science and its applications in various fields such as engineering, physics, health, social sciences and finances. The club aims to provide a place for discussing research papers, where academics can extend their knowledge, foster new ideas, and, possibly, form new collaborations. 
 
**_The meeting structure:_**\
The paper and the presenter will be announced ahead of the meeting. The idea is that all attendees read the article beforehand and come up with questions.  
-	Intro 5’ 
-	Paper presentation 25’ 
-	Questions & informal discussion 15’
\We will rotate presenters among the members to give everyone a chance to present. 
 
**_Sign up:_**\
